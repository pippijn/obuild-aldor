For \projectname, there are the two optional libraries \LibAlgebra~and \LibExtIO. If \LibAlgebra~is found and usable, than \projectname~will offer the functions \adname{assertEquals} and \adname{assertNotEquals} for expression trees. Otherwise these functions cannot be compiled into \projectname. \LibExtIO~is responsible for providing Ansi characters to \projectname. If \projectname~can use the library \LibExtIO~the generated test suites will allow to use colored output and a progress indicator.
