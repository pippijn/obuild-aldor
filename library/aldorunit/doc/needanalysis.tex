\section{Analysis of needs}

In the course of dealing with the topic of ``programmer tests'', the following needs have been identified:

\begin{itemize}

\item Tests have to run without any user input.
\item Tests should give reproducible results.

\item Failing tests should not crash the environment.
\item Possibility to trace segmentation faults down to the point where they occur.
\item Starting every test in a clean environment.
\item Providing a way to trap even errors that cannot be foreseen and proceed with the other tests.

\item Hiding unnecessary information from the user.
\item Leading the tester to the point, where a failure occurs.
\item Being verbose on failed tests -- but only on failed tests.
\item Only require the plain tests from the developer.

\item Being able to assert equality.
\item Being able to assert thrown exceptions.
\item Being able to indicate a failure without assertions.

\end{itemize}
