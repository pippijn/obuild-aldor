--+ Hi Themos,
--+ 
--+    I'm trying the new axiomxl 1.1.11e for AIX RS/6000.  It appears that
--+ for each link, there is a message
--+ 
--+ Looking for key: std-cc-non-std-float
--+ 
--+ This is a problem that Peter B. said was caused by a missing couple
--+ of lines in the .conf file.  I can fix this for myself if I can find 
--+ his old message, but you might want to fix this in the next version.
--+ 
--+    I also tried the 1.1.10 win32 version.  Let me know if you want
--+ to know about these problems (there are lots).
--+ 
--+     Regards,

Hi Themos,

   I'm trying the new axiomxl 1.1.11e for AIX RS/6000.  It appears that
for each link, there is a message

Looking for key: std-cc-non-std-float

This is a problem that Peter B. said was caused by a missing couple
of lines in the .conf file.  I can fix this for myself if I can find 
his old message, but you might want to fix this in the next version.

   I also tried the 1.1.10 win32 version.  Let me know if you want
to know about these problems (there are lots).

    Regards,
