For \projectname, there are the three optional parts. These parts are \target{bin}, \target{maple}, and \target{mathematica}. \target{bin} denotes the command line utility described in \refsec{cascmdline}. \target{maple} refers to the connection between \Maple and \projectname, which is documented in \refsec{casmaple}. \target{mathematica} denotes the connection between \Mathematica and \projectname, as described in \refsec{casmathematica}.

Whether or not these optional parts can be built depends on the libraries and programs the configure process finds on the target system. The missing libraries and programs are reported during the configure process. \refsec{advancedconfiguration} shows how to hint the configure process to missing libraries or programs.

However, the \projectname \Aldor library is fully functional even without these three optional parts.
