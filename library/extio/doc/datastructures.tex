\section{Data structures}

\adtype{ChainingHashTable},
\adtype{ExpressionTree},
\adtype{ExpressionTreeLeaf},
\adtype{List},
\adtype{SingletonRepository},
\adtype{SingletonRepositoryType}, and 
\adtype{Tree}
belong to this part of \projectname.

\adtype{ChainingHashTable} is a semantically sound replacement for the broken \adtype{HashTable} of \LibAldor.

\adtype{ExpressionTree},
\adtype{ExpressionTreeLeaf}, and \adtype{List} are originally defined in either \LibAldor or \LibAlgebra. For these three domains, \projectname just extends their functionality by further categories.

\adtype{List} serves as an example. Although \LibAlgebra provides an \adtype{ExpressionTreeOperator} for lists (\adtype{ExpressionTreeList}), \adtype{List} cannot be transformed into an \adtype{ExpressionTree}. Therefore, \projectname implements this functionality for \adtype{List}{}s.

\inputSourceFile{list/listtree.as}{An example of converting a \adtype{List} to an \adtype{ExpressionTree}}
\inputOutput{list/listtree}

\adtype{SingletonRepository},
\adtype{SingletonRepositoryType}, and 
\adtype{Tree} are defined in \projectname. While \adtype{Tree} is just a data structure for arbitrary trees, \adtype{SingletonRepository} and \adtype{SingletonRepositoryType} are used to associate \adtype{Symbol}{}s with values.
