For \projectname, there are the two optional libraries \LibAlgebra~and \LibAldorUnit. The computer algebra systems part and most type extensions rely on \LibAlgebra. If \LibAlgebra is not found during the confugire process, these parts are not available. \LibAldorUnit is used solely to run the implemented tests for \projectname. If \LibAldorUnit is not found during configure, the targets \target{test} and \target{check} cannot be built.
