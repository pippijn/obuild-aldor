\section{Overview}

The document discusses every step that is necessary to start a new library from scratch with the help of \projectname.

Therefore, this document is divided into the seven parts. These parts are

\begin{itemize}
\item anatomy of a \projectname project,
\item declaration of a \projectname project's needs
\item the include file,
\item the library itself,
\item testing the library,
\item documentation for a \projectname project, and
\item advanced topics.
\end{itemize}

These parts are treated in their corresponding sections (\refsec{anatomy}--\refsec{advancedtopics}).
